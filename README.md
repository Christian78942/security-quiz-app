# CyberClimb Security+ Study Hub

CyberClimb Security+ Study Hub is a study tool designed to help users prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification. This project currently includes features like timed practice exams, acronym flashcards, and warm-up questions, making it an ideal platform for those looking to test and enhance their knowledge of Security+ topics.


## Features
1. **Practice Exam**: A timed, multi-choice exam featuring key Security+ questions, with a 10-minute countdown to simulate test conditions. (Will eventually make it 90 minutes to simulate the actual exam)
2. **Flashcard Acronyms**: Flashcards to help memorize important Security+ acronyms, supporting interactive learning.
3. **Warm-up Questions**: Basic questions to help the user get warmed up for the eventual timed practice exam.


### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (usually included with Node.js)


### Future Enhancements

The following features are planned for future releases to make CyberClimb a more effective study platform:

- **Adaptive Learning**  
  Implement dynamic question difficulty that adjusts based on the user’s performance. If the user answers questions correctly, the system will introduce more challenging questions. If the user struggles, it will provide more foundational questions.

- **Customized Study Plan**  
  After completing a set of questions, offer personalized recommendations on topics to focus on based on the user’s performance, strengths, and weaknesses.

- **Expanded Question Bank**  
  Add more questions to the Practice Exam section to cover a broader range of Security+ topics, creating a more comprehensive study experience.

- **Progress Tracking and Analytics**  
  Track user scores and progress over time. Provide detailed analytics to help users understand their performance across different topics.

- **Enhanced Timer and Exam Mode**  
  Allow users to select different timed modes (e.g., full-length exam simulation, quick quiz) and enable saving progress in case they need to pause.
